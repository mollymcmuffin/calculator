# calculator

- The main purpose of this project is for me to grasp some DOM manipulation.
- Built using flexbox. Probably easier to use Grid instead.
- The result of arithmetic operation will be to 2dp only because of the decimal accuracy in Javascript.
- The calculator has its flaws like result being up to 2 decimal places only.
  - I probably could have converted the decimal numbers to whole numbers and before carrying out the operation to solve the issue.
